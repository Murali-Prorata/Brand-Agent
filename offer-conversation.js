        best: "For Italy trips, the best time to visit is April–June or September–October for mild weather and fewer crowds. If you want the warmest weather with fewer lines, late September is a sweet spot—prices are lower than summer, the air is still warm, and attractions are easier to book.\n\nPlan at least 2–3 months out to lock in better airfare and hotel selection. If you can travel mid-week, you’ll often see the lowest fares and better room availability.",
        hotels: "For families, prioritize apartments or family-friendly hotels in walkable neighborhoods close to transit. Look for places that include breakfast, offer laundry access, and are within a 10–15 minute walk of a major metro or bus line.\n\nCentral areas in Rome (Trastevere or near Campo de' Fiori) and Florence (Oltrarno) reduce daily travel time and make mid-day breaks easier for kids.",
        flights: "Direct flights to Rome are most frequent from major hubs like JFK, ATL, and BOS. Booking 2–3 months ahead often saves money, and mid-week departures are usually cheaper.\n\nIf you can, consider an open-jaw itinerary (arrive Rome, depart Venice) to avoid backtracking—this can save a full day of travel and often costs the same as a round trip.",
        budget: "Set aside $2,400–$6,000 for a family of four depending on season, route, and flexibility. To reduce costs, target shoulder-season travel, fly Tuesday or Wednesday, and keep your lodging in central neighborhoods so you can walk more and spend less on taxis.\n\nA balanced budget usually includes flights, lodging, transit passes, museum tickets, and a daily food allowance."
